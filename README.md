# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Data
 
Problem Statement:-

   This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.

What I have done? 

First I imported the dataset into colab and analyze and understood the data set properly by going through some of the info like columns, info, etc.

After analyzing, I found correlation between all colums and plotted the graph to find out relation between different columns using heatmap.

Then I spillted the data set into train set and test set. I will use train set to create and train the model and test test to further test and found the accuracy at the end. 

I applied Clustering Algorithm and fitted the data set and then did the prediction on the test set.
